Development of the ROM boot loader header generator for Xilinx Zynq based boards
The included sample zed_ezynq.h provides defines for Microzed board, it is to be included in includes/configs/<boardname>.h
After running
  make <boardname>_congig
and then
  make
the include/autoconf.mk will be generated and you can run
  ezynqcfg.py -c include/autoconf.mk [-o boot_head.bin] [--html u-boot.html [--html-mask 255]] [-v]

This command will generate  boot_head.bin and u-boot.html
When there will be u-boot running from OCM, it will be possible to make a bootable immage with
cat boot_head.bin u-boot.bin > boot.bin

For testing the program it is possible to make a shortcut and substitute the autoconf.mk with a manually edited file,
such as test.mk - it has some examples of other valid defines to fine-tune the hardware configuration
